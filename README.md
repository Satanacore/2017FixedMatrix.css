# 2017FixedMatrix.css
Theme for BetterDiscord updated to work with latest patch
If you don't know how to install themes using BetterDiscord I suggest you visit Jiik's website tutorial
Also, I want to go ahead and give credits to the creator of Clearvision, however, I only used it to grab the theme loading messages as I thought they were pretty legit
Here is a preview of the theme for those interested: https://imgur.com/a/v46Ca
I do not care if you use this .css as a template, I do not ask to be credited, as GitHub IS an open source site and it would be pretty autistic for me to get my balls in a vise over it.
Update: I also will take suggestions and help with theme creating, join this server to contact me: https://discord.gg/ARarmFC
